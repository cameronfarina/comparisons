class Array

  # Write an Array#dups method that will return a hash containing the indices of all
  # duplicate elements. The keys are the duplicate elements; the values are
  # arrays of their indices in ascending order, e.g.
  # [1, 3, 4, 3, 0, 3, 0].dups => { 3 => [1, 3, 5], 0 => [4, 6] }

  def dups
    hash = Hash.new { |h, k| h[k] = [] }

    (0...self.length).each do |i|
        hash[self[i]] << i
    end
      hash.select { |k, v| v.length > 1 }
  end
